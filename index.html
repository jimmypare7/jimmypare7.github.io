    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Welcome! My name is Jimmy, I am a mechanical engineering student at The University of Vermont. I use this site to compile some of my personal and school projects. 
      
      In my free time, I enjoy woodworking, speed cubing, powerlifting, and fishing. Feel free to send me a message if there are any questions!

      <h3>End Grain Cutting Boards</h3>
      <p>Here are a couple of images of some of the cutting boards I have made. 
        
        Recently, I have been experimenting with 'chaos boards', which are end grain cutting boards with chaotic patterns in the end grain. I prefer to make end grain cutting boards because of the improved durability and self repairing properties. </p>

      <h3>Epoxy River Tables</h3>
      <p> As of September 2025, I have made 3 epoxy river tables. An epoxy river table was one of the first projects I took on in woodworking because they don't require as many tools as other projects. I outsourced the flattening process, and made a track saw jig for my circular saw cut the slabs to size and make the mold for the epocy pour. </p>
